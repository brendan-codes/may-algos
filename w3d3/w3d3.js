/*
  Create a function to determine the max amount of
  servings that can be made based on a recipe and
  available ingredients.

  Input:
    - recipe object where keys are ingredient names
      and values are unit required (int)
    - available ingredients object where keys are ingredient
      names and values are unit available (int)
  Output:
    int (max servings)

  Side note (possible extra challenge version): Realistically, the values
  would be an object as well with the keys: unit (unit of measure), and amount.
  If the available ingredient was stored in a different unit,
  a conversion table would be needed to convert units of measure.

// Example Input
const recipe = {
    "organic fat": 99,
    "live squid": 1,
    "birds nest": 1,
    "fried flesh": 1,
    "spicy": 5,
    "gourmet memes": 4200,
    "crazy spice": 10
  };

    "birds nest": 10,
    "fried flesh": 10,
    "spicy": 50,
    "gourmet memes": 42000,
    "sugar": 9001,
    "spice": 5,
    "everything nice": 1,
  };
  // Output: 1 because only 1 live squid is available
  // Output: 10 IF we had 10 live squids because then we have 10x of every ingredient
  // Output: 0 IF we had 0 live squids or live squids key didn't exist in 'available'
