### MERN Belt Exam

- Take 100% of the exam timer. Don't give up early, don't throw in the towel after an early setback.

- Always share your code with me after. Even if you didn't pass, it's a code review.

- Don't watch the clock, it's distracting. Set alarms for big landmarks (50%, last hour, last 20 minutes)

- USE the platform, the internet, stack overflow, official documentation, your previous assignments, anything i've ever shared with you, anything your cohort has shared with you

- DON'T USE github solutions, somebody else's solution of this exact app, somebody else's exam, code you didn't write that you found on github.

- Start with what you know you can do. If the wireframe shows you scary features, work around them to get as much features on the board as early as possible.

- Save the hardest parts for last, you don't know how long they'll take, but the easy stuff you can time!

- Save huge bugs for later. Stuck on something annoying about edit or delete? Go back to it after other features are working.

- Be scrappy. This exam is a test of your ability to get things running in a short amount of time, not your ability to write expert code. It must work on the browser, that's it. All your work arounds are valid!

- REMEMBER: Perfect code isn't written on the first pass. Get the features working, refactor later. This exam simulates getting a take home challenge during an interview. Get it done in the time you have, be able to talk about it!

- If you completely go over the exam timer, the wireframe is your new most important assignment.

- If you have to retake, finish the first wireframe out of exam time.

- When you are done, find me to get your exam checked off.

- Remember your training

- Try to have fun

- Build a boilerplate of things you know you will need. You know you need React, Server, mongo.connect, cors, useEFfect, useState, axios, @reach/router


### Brendan's rules

- CSS is optional, but nice

- If you go over the exam timer, do not stop working. Give it to me when you are done.

- Get me the ip address for deployment before the end of the day.

- Give small hints. Ideally I won't look at code.
